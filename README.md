# Universal_Lora_Node
ESP32/SX1276 based open source LoRa Node

## What is it?
The "Universal LoRa Node" is a LoRa Node is a "small" device to communicate with a LoRa gateway.
It's intention is to send and receive data with other LoRa devices or a LoRaWan like TTN.

It is based on a pure ESP32 architecture as the CPU and a SX1276 Radio board.
You can compare it to the well known LoRa Node from Heltec.

## Why?
I like the Heltec board very much but some things are not very well for my purposes. Espacially the powreconsumption is much better with the Universal LoRa Node.
But also the price is important. You can build this device for less than 15$.

## How?
Build it or buy it!

## Licences?
GPL 3.0

## Plans, source code, secrets?
Completely open. No secret knowledge at all. Everything can be found here. If you want to copy this, enhance it or sell it - go for it! You just need to respect the GPL 3.0
